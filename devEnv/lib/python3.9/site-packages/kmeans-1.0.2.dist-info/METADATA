kmeans
===================
.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/numberoverzero/kmeans.png?branch=master
   :target: https://travis-ci.org/numberoverzero/kmeans

python wrapper for a basic c implementation of the k-means algorithm.

**Please review the limitations before using in any capacity where strict
accuracy is required.  There is no overflow detection, and negatives are not
supported.  tuple values cannot exceed 255.**

Installation
===================
::

    pip install kmeans

Usage
===================
::

    import kmeans
    means = kmeans.kmeans(points, k)

``points`` should be a list of tuples of the form ``(data, weight)`` where
``data`` is a list with length 3.

For example, finding four mean colors for a group of pixels::

    pixels = [
        [(15, 20, 25), 1],  # [(r,g,b), count]
        [(17, 31, 92), 5],
        # ... Lots more ...
    ]

    centers = kmeans.kmeans(pixels, 4)

In this case, the weights passed in may be the frequency of the pixels occuring
in an image, or some preference to pull the means towards a color.

Limitations
===================

All values must be **non-negative** **integers**, with the following
restrictions::

    r, g, b        [0, 255]        (uint8_t)
    count          [0, 4294967295] (uint32_t)
    maximum points 4294967296      (uint32_t)
    maximum means  256             (uint8_t)
    max iterations 65536           (uint16_t)
    max tolerance  65536           (uint16_t)


Inspiration
===================

http://charlesleifer.com/blog/using-python-to-generate-awesome-linux-desktop-themes/

I wanted to apply the implementation there to images much larger than 200x200.
Running a 4k x 3k image was approaching 60 seconds on a nice computer, so I
decided to rewrite the kmeans implementation in c.
